Effective indexing strategies can significantly reduce data retrieval times and improve query performance. Here are some essential strategies to consider: Before creating indexes, analyze the queries that are frequently executed. Look for patterns such as filters, sorts, and joins. Use tools like EXPLAIN to understand how queries are executed and which indexes are used. When queries involve multiple columns, consider creating composite indexes. A composite index on columns column1 and column2 can improve the performance of queries that filter or sort on both columns. However, the order of columns in the index matters: CREATE INDEX idx_column1_column2 ON table_name (column1",

This could be used in a number of scenarios such as training a data science machine learning model (SVMs, decision trees, KNN's), finetuning a different GPT model on the data, as a solution to the coldstart problem, helping build compelling demos/apps with realistic data, scenario testing etc. There are a number of key drivers which may see you wanting to leverage synthetic data. Human data may have privacy restrictions and/or identifiable data within it which we do not want to be used.
