However, a critical challenge in LLM applications lies in their inherent limitation: the LLM context window. LLMs can only effectively analyze and reason over a limited amount of text at once. This constraint hinders their performance in tasks requiring broader contextual understanding, such as semantic search or document summarization.Chunking emerges as a powerful strategy to overcome this limitation. Chunking refers to the process of dividing large pieces of text into smaller, more manageable segments.

This could be used in a number of scenarios such as training a data science machine learning model (SVMs, decision trees, KNN's), finetuning a different GPT model on the data, as a solution to the coldstart problem, helping build compelling demos/apps with realistic data, scenario testing etc. There are a number of key drivers which may see you wanting to leverage synthetic data. Human data may have privacy restrictions and/or identifiable data within it which we do not want to be used. Synthetic data can be much more structured and therefore easier to manipulate than real data. In domains where data is sparse",

But they often struggle with producing consistent, structured outputs. Ask for JSON, and you might get a mix of text and JSON\u2014sometimes spot on, sometimes a mess. This makes them hard to use directly in production. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore five open-source libraries to make LLM outputs reliable and ready for real-world applications.1.
