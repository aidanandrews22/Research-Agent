However, a critical challenge in LLM applications lies in their inherent limitation: the LLM context window. LLMs can only effectively analyze and reason over a limited amount of text at once. This constraint hinders their performance in tasks requiring broader contextual understanding, such as semantic search or document summarization.Chunking emerges as a powerful strategy to overcome this limitation. Chunking refers to the process of dividing large pieces of text into smaller, more manageable segments.

However, when it comes to the structured world of tabular data, these powerful models face unique hurdles. While LLMs excel at understanding and generating human language, the rigid structure and lack of context in CSVs present a challenge. Let's explore these challenges and discuss how we can bridge the gap between the structured data within CSVs and the contextual understanding that LLMs thrive on, based on the following mechanisms:Humanizing Data: The first step is to make the data more digestible for LLMs. Instead of raw n",
