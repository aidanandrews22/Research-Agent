But what exactly is indexing? Think of it as a roadmap within a database (opens new window) that swiftly guides you to your desired destination. Just like an index at the end of a book, indexing creates pointers to data locations, making retrieval faster and more efficient. The significance of indexing cannot be overstated.

However, manually sifting through these files can be time-consuming and inefficient. This is where a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application can come in handy.A RAG application is a type of AI system that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with the ability to retrieve and incorporate relevant information from external sources. In this article, we\u2019ll explore how you can use a RAG application to query CSV or Excel files and get answers to your questions.1: Load and Prepare your dataThe first step is to ensure that your CSV or Excel file is properly formatted and ready for proc",
