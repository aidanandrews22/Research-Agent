Here's a breakdown of why this is the case, and some strategies to improve your read performance. 1. SQLAlchemy Adds Overhead SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) which facilitates interaction with a database using Python objects. This convenience means there are some additional processes, such as translating raw data into Python native types and handling various type conversions, which introduces additional overhead, slowing down data fetching compared to reading raw data from a CSV. 2.

In this guide, we will explore how to parse CSV files in TypeScript using the popular csv-parse library. Installing csv-parse Before we begin parsing CSV files in TypeScript, we need to install the csv-parse library. You can install it using npm or yarn: npm install csv-parse yarn add csv-parse Parsing CSV Files Once we have installed the csv-parse library, we can start parsing CSV files in TypeScript. Below is an example of how you can parse a CSV file using csv-parse in TypeScript: import * as fs from 'fs'; import * as csvParse from 'csv-parse'; const csvData: string = fs.readFileSync('data.csv', 'utf8'); csvParse(csvDa",

However, when it comes to the structured world of tabular data, these powerful models face unique hurdles. While LLMs excel at understanding and generating human language, the rigid structure and lack of context in CSVs present a challenge. Let's explore these challenges and discuss how we can bridge the gap between the structured data within CSVs and the contextual understanding that LLMs thrive on, based on the following mechanisms:Humanizing Data: The first step is to make the data more digestible for LLMs. Instead of raw n",

This often involves integrating retrieval techniques to access external data sources. One popular method is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which retrieves relevant information and appends it to a user's query to enhance response accuracy. However, traditional RAG systems often strip crucial context from retrieved chunks, leading to lower-quality outputs. In response, Contextual Retrieval has emerged as an innovati",
