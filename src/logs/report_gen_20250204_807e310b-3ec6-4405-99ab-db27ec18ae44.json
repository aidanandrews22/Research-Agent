Here's a breakdown of why this is the case, and some strategies to improve your read performance. 1. SQLAlchemy Adds Overhead SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) which facilitates interaction with a database using Python objects. This convenience means there are some additional processes, such as translating raw data into Python native types and handling various type conversions, which introduces additional overhead, slowing down data fetching compared to reading raw data from a CSV. 2.
