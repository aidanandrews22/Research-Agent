What topic would you like a report on?
I am building a tool that extracts relevant data from a CSV file based on a user's query and provides that data to an already implemented LLM. I need a comprehensive overview of the best methods for developing a CSV agent that efficiently retrieves and structures relevant data. Please include state-of-the-art techniques, libraries, and frameworks that optimize parsing, indexing, and querying large CSV files. Prioritize approaches that integrate well with LLMs for context-aware retrieval.

## Main Content

**AI in medical imaging is revolutionizing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.** Recent advancements, such as AI-driven wound healing prediction systems, demonstrate how machine learning models can analyze complex medical images with precision beyond human capability. For instance, SpectralAI's DeepView¬Æ technology uses multispectral imaging and AI to predict wound healing outcomes, significantly improving patient care and reducing healthcare costs.

The regulatory landscape for AI in radiology is evolving rapidly. According to Health Imaging, regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on ensuring AI tools meet stringent safety and efficacy standards. This shift is driven by the need to balance innovation with patient safety, as AI systems become more integrated into clinical workflows.

A notable example is the development of multimodal AI chatbots for diagnosing ophthalmic diseases. A study published in *npj Digital Medicine* highlights how these chatbots can analyze both textual and visual data to provide accurate diagnoses and high-quality medical responses, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in healthcare.

**AI-driven predictive models are enhancing oncology outcomes through advanced data analysis.** Recent studies demonstrate how machine learning and AI are transforming cancer care by predicting patient outcomes with high accuracy. For instance, a study published in *Journal of Patient-Reported Outcomes* analyzed machine learning models incorporating patient-reported data, revealing significant improvements in predicting oncology outcomes compared to traditional methods.

A notable example is the use of AI to extract clinical data from electronic health records. A study in *Nature* showed that AI models can predict cancer survival rates by analyzing clinical notes from over 20,000 patients, identifying genomic features and treatment responses with remarkable precision. This approach not only enhances predictive accuracy but also streamlines data processing, enabling faster decision-making in clinical settings.

Additionally, trends in AI applications in radiology highlight the growing integration of deep learning techniques. A bibliographic analysis in *Journal of Contemporary Clinical Practice* revealed that AI models are increasingly being used to predict biochemical outcomes in recurrent prostate cancer, offering personalized treatment recommendations and improving patient care.
