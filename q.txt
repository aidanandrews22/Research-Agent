I am building a tool that extracts relevant data from a CSV file based on a user's query and provides that data to an already implemented LLM. I need a comprehensive overview of the best methods for developing a CSV agent that efficiently retrieves and structures relevant data. Please include state-of-the-art techniques, libraries, and frameworks that optimize parsing, indexing, and querying large CSV files. Prioritize approaches that integrate well with LLMs for context-aware retrieval.
